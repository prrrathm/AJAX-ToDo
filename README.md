# AJAX ToDo By Pratham Sharma

This is a basic ToDo list made with the help of AJAX and FormData object.

> FormData Object is arguably one of the most useful Object of JavaScript which converts a form entries into JavaScript Object. Although the process of retrieving the elements is not as direct, but it still saves a lot of time and can be implemented in any code.

> AJAX is abbrevation for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, it is an essential tool for getting data from an external file or API in the form of text, XML or HTML. It's biggest feature is that it doesn't reload the whole page when changing the data of an element of DOM.

We are using both of these tools in our project, FormData helps us in adding and deleting the data in an external XML file whereas AJAX will help us in adding the deleting the data back into the HTML from the XML file.
